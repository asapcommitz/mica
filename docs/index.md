# Mica Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Mica, a collection of absolutely tiny tools for Linux.

## Getting Started

If you are new to Mica, start with the building guide to learn how to compile these tools for your system.

* [Building Guide](building.md)

## Tool Documentation

Detailed information about each tool in the Mica collection:

* [mfetch](mfetch.md) - Neofetch-style system fetcher
* [mnet](mnet.md) - Network status & diagnostic tool

## Philosophy

Mica is built with a focus on:
- **Static Everything**: Binaries are statically linked and have no dependencies.
- **Pure Data**: Information is read directly from kernel interfaces like `/proc` and `/sys`.
- **Minimalism**: Binaries are kept under 1MB (usually much smaller) and optimized for size.
